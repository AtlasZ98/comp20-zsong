# Assignment 4:  Security and Privacy Assessment of Private Car Service

For the vulnerability issues part I was only able to identify a few. I think my partner's way of turning the whole collection to array and then using her own way of finding the document makes database injection really hard for me to do.

For this assignment I collaborated with my partner to see her code so that I could "hack" easier.

I spent 10+ hours doing this assignment because I really had a hard time finding the vulnerabilities in the mongodb, trying to do database injection.
