# This is the private repository for Ziyu Song in COMP 20, Spring 2019 at Tufts University.


## Purpose:
This Github repository contains the coding work done during taking COMP 20. 

## Favorite assignment during the semester
Definitely heroku. It's great that I get to learn using a docker container. Thought making a real web server would be quite hard but it turns out to be very straightforward.

## Progress during the course
Now I know more about the web. It is so ubiquitous but so abstracted, so I feel a bit more in control knowing better about it. Being given pre-made tools is cool and convinient, but knowing what it is absolutely helps me gaining more control over such powerful thing.
Also I have become familiar with many real-world terms being used for web dev, such as Node.js, npm, and Heroku. I learned a bit about git before this course, which confirms that it is so important knowing how to do version control.

## Most important thing learned
The most precious thing from this course is to keep security in mind. I could never be able to make my code absolute secure, but it's worthy to try the best I could. I would like to analogize security to ethics: it's hard to be objectively ethical, but thinking about ethics makes a huge difference because the issue happens mostly because people don't care. Same idea applies to security in programs.

## For the future
I would like to know more about web-application frameworks. In this course we learned node.js, but I've been hearing Django and Ruby-on-rails for quite several years and I want to know how they work, how they are implemented, more than how to use them.
