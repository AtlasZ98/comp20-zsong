# Assignment 2: The Private Car Service

All the required work has been correctly implemented. 

I discussed with Ugo about how to select images for google map markers.
I looked up why the computeDistance google api didn't work and consulted this source:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43800719/google-maps-computedistancebetween-not-working/43800799. 
I also looked up this https://tommcfarlin.com/multiple-infowindows-google-maps/ to figure out how to make mulitple infoWindows.

I spent about 5 hours on this assignment.
